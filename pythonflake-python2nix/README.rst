Nix Flake development Environment for Python
--------------------------------------------

Just go through and rename `pythonflake` to your project name. Doesn't seem to work with either hyphens or underscores in the project name so beware. The useful commands are then
`nix develop` to enter a shell
`nix run` to run the application
`nix build` to build it
